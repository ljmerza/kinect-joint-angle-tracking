# kinect-joint-angle-tracking

This program is similar to the basic skeleton tracking but also extracts position data for each limb. Â This program will display the angle of all 4 major joints in your body in radians. The code for this project is similar to my basic skelton tracking project <a href="http://blog.lmerza.com/?p=89">here</a> so only the vector mathematics will be focused on in this post.
